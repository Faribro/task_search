Create a search page with a search bar that, on input, should show ads matching the keyword entered. Searching across the company name, primary text, headline, and description in a single query will be a good idea (Hint: aggregate, and unwind functions). Also, display the ads in a grid format. Prefer to create a functional component(s). Mongo collections can be like in this sheet.
